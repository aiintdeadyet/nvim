# Ideas

## Pluggins
_**For pluggin ideas look at https://dotfyle.com/**_

## General
- take a look at https://github.com/jdah/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/nvim/init.lua
this is a youtuber that has a pretty good nvim config and might be worth taking a look at

- replace ideas.md with a simple to do list text file

- let me use apostraphies in comments

- make it so that I can open tabs with telescope

- make file manager open to the directory of the current file 

- make it so that I don't need to add file refferecnes to lua/settings/init.lua whenever I add a file (might want to look at how lazynvim is called)

## Problems
fix python libraries not working with the debugger
